     * - Use `` as the base for added lines.

         * This format appears in GitHub code diffs to describe the location and size of changes in a file.

         * Example:
         * Understanding the components of the diff header:
         * - `-48,6` refers to the LEFT side (original file):
         *    - `48`: The starting line number of the changed block in the original file.
         *    - `6`: The number of lines in the block from the original file.
         *
         * - `+49,8` refers to the RIGHT side (modified file):
         *    - `49`: The starting line number of the changed block in the modified file.
         *    - `8`: The number of lines in the block from the modified file.
         *
         * - Additional context (if any) follows the header, describing the location of changes, such as the function
         *   or class name. This is optional and may be omitted if no specific context exists.
         *
         * # Diff Analysis Guide:

         * Notes:
         * - Ensure that the line counts (`6`, `8`) are accurate, even if newline characters are included.
         * - LEFT represents the original state of the file, and RIGHT represents the modified state.
         * - Line counts refer to consecutive lines in the changed block.
